## Intro

OCamlSDL2_Net brings you access to the SDL2_net library from OCaml.

## Current State

These relays are currently in a very early draft state.
You may expect to get segfaults.
These pieces of code are currently called "relays" and 
not bindings while there is currently no memory management and 
no integration with the garbage collector.

## Relicensing

If SDL_net changes its license in the future to any FLOSS / OSI approved 
license, you can use these relays under the terms of the same license.
